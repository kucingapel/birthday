Dear my favorite weirdo,


Happy birthday~! WOOOO WHAT A SPECIAL DAY AY AY AY OH what a fabulous day it is! 

Thank you for being patient, understanding, and loving throughout the past 11 months together.

We may have had an unusual beginning, and our time together has been out of the norm.

But we've pushed through, and I am incredibly thankful for you.

We may feel distant, we may feel apart

In an effort to fill that gap, I have began our first project: Journey

Let Journey become a small hub for us to collect and nourish memories and experience.

to hold and represent our journey together. As we embark forward,

Please do accept my apology for delivering this letter late.
