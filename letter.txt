Dear Rika!

Hello love~~! I hope you’re doing well <3 I miss you!! Remember when I said you radiated cat/kitten energy? I thought the magic performed only when we were calling, but alas, I have been proved otherwise. As I strut towards the library, thinking about what to write for you, 호랭이 was like BAM YOU SHALL NOT CWOSS! and blocked(?) my path. Had an intense chasing sesh tryna escape her grasp. She was adamant. But I couldn’t leave her easily, because all cats remind me of you, and I can’t help but give them an extra squeeze. If you run into a cat, please squeeze em too. Complete the hug <3

My love, I wanted to apologize for what happened last night. My sarcastic comments hurt you. I should have been more careful on what to say and when to say it, rather than rushing to try and make you laugh. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you, rika. It must have been difficult pushing through my nonchalant comment, and even harder bringing up later. I really am a 바보 after all. It seems these days I am making a lot of mistakes. I worry it’s upsetting you too much. Please, forgive me. You always help me become a better man, and I can’t thank you enough for that. I never take you for granted, and I understand I must show it through action. I will try harder, be softer, and do my best to help you feel loved, help you feel happy, help you laugh more. 미안해. 그리고 고마워.]

I hope you are alright. You did well rika <3 You are incredibly brave and thoughtfu. Spending time with you is always the highlight of my day. It’ll always be my goal to make the same for you too.

Love, Seunggun
