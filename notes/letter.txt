Dear my favorite weirdo,


Happy birthday~! WOOOO WHAT A SPECIAL DAY AY AY AY OH what a fabulous day it is! 

Thank you for being patient, understanding, and loving throughout the past 11 months together.

We may have had an unusual beginning, and our time together has been out of the norm.

But we've pushed through, and I am incredibly thankful for you.

There may be times when feel distant. There may be moments when we feel apart.

But please never forget, you are always in my heart <3

In celerbation of such a wonderful day, and in an effort to fill that gap, I have began our first project: Journey

Let Journey become a small hub for us to collect and nourish memories and experience.

A sandbox for us to build, play, and try new things.

A record for our mutual /attempts and experiences.

A haven for our comfort and safety.

One of the many journies we will share, together 
Please do accept my apology for delivering this letter late.
