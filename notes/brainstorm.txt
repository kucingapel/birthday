We may not be right next to each other (at least five footsteps away)

and there are times when our distance seems unbearable

Traveling, humor, discovering new language and culture

why do we like travel? because we get to explore

differences while finding comonalities among people we meet

people of different backgrounds, cultures, beliefs, religions..

In a sense, our relationship has been a journey of our own

similarities (bond us together)

differences (teach each other)
